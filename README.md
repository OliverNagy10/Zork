# ZORK Game

## Overview
ZORK is a UI-based game developed using C++ and the QT framework. The game involves exploring islands, battling monsters, and interacting with various characters and items. The project showcases a variety of C++ features and programming techniques, making it a valuable resource for learning and exploration.

## Techniques/Features
- **Virtual Functions:** Utilizes virtual functions for polymorphism, allowing for dynamic behavior based on the actual type of an object at runtime.
- **Template Classes and Functions:** Demonstrates the use of template classes and functions for generic programming.
- **Multiple Inheritance:** Takes advantage of multiple inheritance to create complex class hierarchies.
- **Namespaces:** Uses namespaces to organize code and prevent naming conflicts.
- **Programmer Defined Exceptions:** Implements custom exceptions to handle specific error conditions.
- **Unions:** Utilizes unions to allow storage of different data types in the same memory location.
- **Dynamic Casting:** Demonstrates the use of dynamic_cast for safe casting between polymorphic types.
- **Operator Overloading:** Overloads operators for custom classes to define meaningful behaviors.
- **Abstract Classes:** Defines abstract classes with pure virtual functions, providing a blueprint for derived classes.
- **Copy Constructors:** Implements copy constructors for deep and shallow copy semantics.
- **Bit Structures:** Utilizes bit structures for efficient storage and manipulation of data.
- **Advanced Pre-processor Directives:** Uses advanced pre-processor directives for conditional compilation and inclusion.
- **Initializer List:** Takes advantage of initializer lists for efficient object initialization.
- **C++ References and Pointers:** Utilizes references and pointers for memory management and efficient data access.
- **Inheritance and Destructors:** Implements inheritance and proper memory cleanup using destructors.
- **Memory Management:** Manages memory allocation and deallocation for efficient resource usage.
- **Header Files:** Organizes code into header files with inclusion guards to prevent multiple inclusions.
- **Arrays and Pointers:** Demonstrates the use of arrays and pointers for efficient data manipulation.
- **Friendship:** Uses friend functions and classes to allow access to private and protected members.
- **Basic Pre-processor Directives:** Implements basic pre-processor directives for conditional compilation.
- **Global Variables:** Utilizes global variables for shared state across the program.
- **Private, Public, Protected:** Demonstrates the use of access specifiers for controlling access to class members.


## Compilation and Execution
1. Open the project file (ZORK.pro) using the QT Creator or your preferred QT development environment.
2. Configure the project settings as needed.
3. Build the project to generate the executable.
4. Run the executable to launch the ZORK game.
